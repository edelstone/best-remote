## Overview

[Best Remote](http://bestremote.work) is a collection of resources from today's top remote companies, organized in a clean, consumable, and fun way.

## Why I made this

I've been doing a lot of research on remote companies for my next job opportunity, and I think it might help others who are interested in remote work. There are [lots](https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job/blob/master/README.md) [of](https://weworkremotely.com/) [good](https://github.com/jessicard/remote-jobs/blob/master/README.md) [resources](https://remotebase.io/) out there on remote jobs, but none that focus specifically on gathering the most interesting information (recruitment sites, articles, blog posts, interviews, etc.) about the absolute best companies.

## My criteria

I personally gravitate towards organizations with an opinionated view of themselves. They've thought pretty deeply about their culture and they signal it, whether in the form of a well-crafted recruitment page, frequent blog posts, podcast appearances, or whatever. I'm also only featuring organizations that are “remote-first” or “remote-friendly”, not merely “remote-allowed” or those with firm geographic restrictions.
